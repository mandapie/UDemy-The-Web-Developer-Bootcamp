## Command Line Basic Exercise

* Make new folder name "Animals"
* Inside of "Animals" and 2 directories: "AwesomeAnimals" and "SketchyAnimals"
* Inside of "AwesomeAnimals" add the following files: "Capybara.js", "ArcticFox.html", and "TreeFrog.txt"
* Inside of "SketchyAnimals" add the following files: "BrownRecluse.html" and "BulletAnt.js"
* Also inside of "SketchyAnimals" create a "Snakes" directory. Snakes are extra sketchy
* Inside of "Snakes" create the following files; "Cobra.css" and "ReticulatedPython.py"
* You have a change of heart and decide that BulletAnt are no longer sketchy. Remove the files
* All animal life goes extinct. Delete the directory.

** Bonus: See if you can do this without ever changing directories (without using cd) **
